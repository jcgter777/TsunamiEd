  <h1 id="title">MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE EDUCATED ABOUT TSUNAMIS!!!</h1>
  <h5>More people educated about tsunamis means less people's lives taken by tsunamis</h5>
  <br><p>Study shows that children in school that learn about tsunamis have a better chance of surviving it because they know how to protect themselves. </p>
  <br><p>People have shown that when they know what a tsunami is, what it does, what it can do, its signs and its causes, they can protect themselves better. How? </p>
  <br><p id="alert">There's a severe earthquake. <i>TSUNAMI ALERT!</i> Water is being sucked away from the shore. <i>TSUNAMI ALERT!</i></p>
  <br><p>There is a city in Japan called Kamaishi, which had twice been destroyed by tsunamis. School officials decided to make their students tsunami experts. So, they incorporated tsunamis into most of their subjects. When one day, a very severe earthquake rocked them, they knew that there was going to be a tsunami, and they were going to be ready for it. So, the students from a junior high school started running away, toward higher ground. A nearby elementary school was keeping their children on their third floor, but when they saw the older kids running, they did too. They went very high, until they could be sure that they would be safe. The tsunami came, and destroyed the town, and also the third floor of the elementary school that teachers and their students were planning to hide in. Because of the tsunami-educated middle-schoolers, hundreds of lives were saved.</p>
  <br><p>Almost 8,000 people are killed each year because of tsunamis, and over 2,000,000 are affected by them. If people are educated, these numbers can be greatly reduced.</p>
